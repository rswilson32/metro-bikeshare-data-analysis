# metro-bikeshare-data-analysis

Data csv's and API access is from https://bikeshare.metro.net/about/data/.
This project is focused on analyzing metro bikeshare rental demand over the past two years. Topics include demand shifts over time based on region, pass type, and bike type.
While this python notebook has all of my code, analysis and reccomendations based off of my visualizations can be found on my website: https://rswilson32.github.io/
